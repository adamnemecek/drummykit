Drummykit

v 1.0, Miloslav Èíž, 2014

ABOUT

This is a 3D MIDI drummer written in C++. It's free,
you can do whatever you want with it as long as you
don't sell it (cause it uses a library that is free
only for non-comercial use). It should be
multiplatform but I have only compiled it for Win64.
If you want to compile under Linux etc., know that
the project requires these libraries:

- Irrlicht (3D game engine)
- IrrKlang (sound engine)
- Midilib (MIDI parser, included with sources)

HOW TO USE

Simply open the drummykit.exe file. Type in the name
of the file to be loaded (e.g. songs/toxicity.mid)
into the filename field. You can also specify the
track to be loaded - either a number or "a" meaning
automatically detect the drum tracks. Hit play and
enjoy.
